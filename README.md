This is an experimental education project which might foster ever emerging architectures of freedom, justice and peace.

### Community
This project hides valuable secrets in plain sight to invite people to overcome their ignorance. 

## Tutorial
To support future freedom lovers I share how I did things:   
1. Decide on which Blockchain you want to launch your Architectures of Freedom  
2. Program the smart contracts as building blocks for your Architectures of Freedom  
3. Buy the currency you need to pay for the gas fees  
4. Deploy your smart contracts  
5. Test them back and forth, left and right and upside down  
6. Start promoting your Architectures of Freedom by letting people know about them
7. Experiment 

## Timeline
1. Deployment of Freedom on Polygon POS  
2. Deployment of educational ecosystem contracts
